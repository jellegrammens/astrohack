# Astrohack
Predicting stellar mass of galaxies from g-band intensities. Weekend hackathon organized by Data Science Ghent
Coders: Mihailo Backovic, Jelle Grammens, Bart Verbeeren, Elissa Matton. 

Got third place


## Instructions

To avoid dependency hell, recreate our conda environment:
`conda env create -f env/astro.yml`

and activate it wherever you'll be running the code:
`source activate [name]`

The environment name is listed in env/astro.yml.

Now you're all set to run in serial (flow.py) or parallel batch mode (run_batch.sh).
